INSTRUCTIONS: You are expected to communicate your knowledge and understanding of chemical
principles in a clear and logical manner. Your steps and assumptions leading to a
solution must be written in the spaces below the questions. Answers must include
units where appropriate and be given to the correct number of significant figures.
For questions involving calculations, full marks will NOT be given for
providing only an answer.
